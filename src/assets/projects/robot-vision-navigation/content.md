## Overview
Combined OpenCV perception with particle filtering and A* planning to follow colored waypoints. Tuned closed-loop behavior for reliable on-table navigation.

## Highlights
- Designed the vision pipeline with color segmentation plus morphological cleanup.
- Estimated robot pose via EKF and fused wheel odometry with visual beacons.
- Executed waypoint tracking with obstacle-aware path smoothing.

## Notes
- Record a short clip of the Thymio completing a course and embed it here later.
