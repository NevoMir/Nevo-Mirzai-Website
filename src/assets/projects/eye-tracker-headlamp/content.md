## Overview
Combined an optical camera, IR camera, and dual servos driven by a Raspberry Pi 5 to keep the headlamp beam parallel to the detected gaze vector.

## Highlights
- Implemented closed-loop control that corrects aim using camera feedback.
- Integrated servo drivers, power delivery, and safety interlocks.
- Optimized calibration so users can remap gaze in under a minute.

## Notes
- Include wiring diagrams and calibration screenshots when available.
