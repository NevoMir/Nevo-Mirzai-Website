## Overview
Modeled the construction environment in MATLAB, designed IK solvers, and validated real-time feasibility for Hong Kong building codes.

## Highlights
- Built a kinematic chain with joint-limit enforcement for each scaffold segment.
- Integrated collision checking against scaffold elements and surrounding structures.
- Demonstrated real-time control loops for assisted placement of beams.

## Notes
- Add screengrabs of the MATLAB simulation and IK debug plots when ready.
