## Overview
Evaluated different MPC formulations, modeled vehicle dynamics, and developed a simulation harness to compare controllers under tight turns and obstacles.

## Highlights
- Linearized the bicycle model for predictive control under speed constraints.
- Benchmarked tracking error versus compute budget for multiple solvers.
- Packaged the stack with visualization overlays for instructor demos.

## Notes
- Add plots comparing solver latency once the experiments are cleaned up.
