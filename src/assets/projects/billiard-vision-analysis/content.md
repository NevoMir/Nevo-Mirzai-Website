# Project Notebook Placeholder

Replace this file with the full notebook-style story for the project. You can use Markdown plus raw HTML just like the articles.

## Embedding assets
- Reference images stored in this project folder with Markdown: `![Rig](images/example.png)`.
- Embed videos via HTML: `<video src="videos/demo.mp4" controls></video>`.
- Add slide embeds from Google Slides using the same iframe snippet as the articles.

Once the real write-up is ready, delete this placeholder section.
