## Overview
Focused on locomotion control inside OpenAI Gym, contrasting CPG-inspired controllers with policy gradients. Reward shaping and curriculum learning were iterated to achieve smooth gaits and fast convergence.

## Highlights
- Implemented baseline CPG and Cartesian PID controllers for reference trajectories.
- Experimented with PPO and SAC, selecting hyperparameters for stability versus speed.
- Crafted terrain-aware reward functions that favored energy-efficient steps.

## Notes
- Add screenshots of the simulation arena and reward plots when available.
