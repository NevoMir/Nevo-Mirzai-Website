## Overview
Used the Youniverse dataset to engineer behavioral features, trained ML classifiers, and evaluated interpretability for content teams.

## Highlights
- Built a feature pipeline covering sentiment, timing, and creator history.
- Compared gradient boosting versus lightweight neural approaches.
- Delivered dashboards that visualize false-positive clusters for reviewers.

## Notes
- Add SHAP-style plots once the interpretability notebook is polished.
