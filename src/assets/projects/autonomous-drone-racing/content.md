## Overview
Simulated laps with synthetic gates, applied computer vision for gate detection, and transferred motion primitives to hardware while accounting for aerodynamic drift.

## Highlights
- Used ROS + Gazebo to validate trajectories before flight tests.
- Incorporated obstacle-avoidance modules for pop-up barriers.
- Optimized PID gains for tight corners and altitude stability.

## Notes
- Embed the final race footage once it is exported from the flight logs.
